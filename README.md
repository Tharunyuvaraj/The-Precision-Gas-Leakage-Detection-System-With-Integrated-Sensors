# The-Precision-Gas-Leakage-Detection-System-With-Integrated-Sensors
Gas leaks pose significant safety risks in both residential and industrial settings, making gas leakage detectors essential safety devices
for many years. These detectors serve the crucial function of identifying the presence of hazardous gases, such as carbon monoxide, and activating
an alarm system to promptly alert occupants of the building. This innovative gas leak detection system leverages mobile technology, integrating
phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp, and GPS location services. Additionally, it features a unique capability to shut off the power supply in the affected
area, providing a real-time and effective means of gas leak detection and containment. This gas leakage detection system prototype has been
successfully developed and tested with gases such as BUTANE and PROPENE. The experimental results demonstrate that the system can detect
gas leaks in less than a minute. The primary objective of this gas detection project is to implement a security system for identifying gas leaks in
closed environments. It utilizes MQ-2 sensors designed to function effectively within enclosed spaces. Furthermore, this system can be seamlessly
integrated with other security and safety systems for enhanced overall protection.
